## Project Overview

This project was completed as part of the Honors portion of the **IBM Machine Learning with Python course on Coursera**. The goal of the project was to build a classifier capable of predicting whether there will be rain the following day, based on historical weather data.

### Dataset

The dataset used for this project was sourced from the Australian Government's Bureau of Meteorology. It contains daily weather observations from 2008 to 2017. The dataset includes several weather-related features such as temperature, rainfall, humidity, wind speed, and more, along with the target variable, **RainTomorrow**, which indicates whether it will rain the next day.

You can access the dataset from the [Bureau of Meteorology](http://www.bom.gov.au/climate/dwo/) or from the Rattle repository [here](https://bitbucket.org/kayontoga/rattle/src/master/data/weatherAUS.RData).

### Key Features

### Methodology

In this project, I cleaned and preprocessed the dataset, then applied various machine learning classification algorithms to build a predictive model for rain prediction. The algorithms used include:

1. **Linear Regression**
2. **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**
3. **Decision Trees**
4. **Logistic Regression**
5. **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**

### Evaluation Metrics

The performance of the models was evaluated using the following metrics:

1. Accuracy Score
2. Jaccard Index
3. F1-Score
4. Log Loss
5. Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
6. Mean Squared Error (MSE)
7. RÂ²-Score
